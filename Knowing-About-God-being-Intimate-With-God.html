<p>We can easily quote passages in scripture about God and His relationship with us but still feel distant. Knowing about God is not the same as having an intimate relationship with Him.</p>
<p>From “A praying life” by Paul E. Miller.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Your relationship with your heavenly father is dysfunctional. You talk as if you have an intimate relationship but you don’t. Theoretically it is close, but practically, it is distant. You need help.</p>

Either the reader needs background information or you want to dive deeper into a topic. Think of parenthetical notes as your child interrupting you while you’re talking; its impolite to distract a reader.</p>
<p>A few alternatives for using “-”, “,…,” and “(…)”:</p>
<ul>
<li>don’t include them; they may not be that important afterall.</li>
<li>use foot/margin notes; give the reader the freedom to be distracted.</li>
<li>Add another, separate sentence or paragraph before or after the sentence; you may be brainstorming while writing and need to focus on one or the other.</li>

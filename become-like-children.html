<p>Thoughts of my future have become an uncertainty in my life. Thoughts like:</p>
<ul>
<li>“Where is my next job going to be”</li>
<li>“I need to plan for the future”</li>
<li>“What if this intership doesn’t turn into a fulltime position?”</li>
<li>“Am I to go back to school?”</li>
<li>“Will I fail the GRE if I do?”</li>
<li>“Would I afford to work part time and go to school?” These keep me up at night.</li>
</ul>
<p>Below is a devotional that hits home for me. I need to keep my trust in God and become like a child. I remember when I was 7 years old - not a care in the world. I would wake up and ask my Dad for breakfast. I would go play and when I was hungry I would ask my Gran for lunch. When I was sad I could go cry to my Dad. I never once worried about where I would get my clothes from or where my food would be.</p>
<p>This is the same attitutude as an adult I shouldn’t forget. Take my life one day at a time. Planning is not evil - but worry is. I know I am where God wants me to be right now. The next step - I don’t know. But I do know that it’ll be a wonderful surprise that God has waiting for me!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It doth not yet appear what we shall be. 1 John 3:2</p>
<p>Naturally, we are inclined to be so mathematical and calculating that we look upon uncertainty as a bad thing. We imagine that we have to reach some end, but that is not the nature of spiritual life. The nature of spiritual life is that we are certain in our uncertainty, consequently we do not make our nests anywhere. Common sense says — “Well, supposing I were in that condition.…” We cannot suppose ourselves in any condition we have never been in.</p>
<p>Certainty is the mark of the commonsense life: gracious uncertainty is the mark of the spiritual life. To be certain of God means that we are uncertain in all our ways, we do not know what a day may bring forth. This is generally said with a sigh of sadness, it should be rather an expression of breathless expectation. We are uncertain of the next step, but we are certain of God. Immediately we abandon to God, and do the duty that lies nearest, He packs our life with surprises all the time. When we become advocates of a creed, something dies; we do not believe God, we only believe our belief about Him. Jesus said, “Except ye…become as little children.” Spiritual life is the life of a child. We are not uncertain of God, but uncertain of what He is going to do next. If we are only certain in our beliefs, we get dignified and severe and have the ban of finality about our views; but when we are rightly related to God, life is full of spontaneous, joyful uncertainty and expectancy. - “The Graciousness Of Uncertainty”, Oswald Chambers</p>

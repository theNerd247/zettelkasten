<p>I’ve been using a Zettelkasten for a week and am noticing some huge reasons for using it. As well as some principles for why making a Zettelkasten isn’t the same as making a personal internet.</p>
<p>A Zettelkasten is a personalized note taking system where:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>notes are taken on cards (physical or electronic); not notebooks</p></li>
<li><p>each card has:</p>
<ul>
<li>a title</li>
<li>a set of tags</li>
<li>a set of direct links to other other tags</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Contains only personalized content A Zettelkasten’s purpose is:</p></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>to record your thoughts to help organize them</li>
<li>to discover connections between your thoughts that would never have been made had your ideas weren’t explicitly written down and tagged.</li>
<li>to reinforce things you’ve learned</li>
<li>invest in your future work.</li>
<li>to discover connections between ideas that seem completely unrelated</li>
</ul>
<p>This last point is important. I’ve seen the idea of creating per-topic Zettelkastens or even linking Zettelkastens between multiple people. But here’s my response to these two ideas: they’re unecessary and break the idea of a Zettelkasten. Here’s why:</p>
<ul>
<li>Multiple Zettelkastens that are unrelated are pointless because they rid us of being able to discover connections between potentially unrelated ideas.</li>
<li>Per topic Zettelkastens that are connected form a…Zettelkasten! So by definition you can’t have connected Zettelkastens.</li>
<li>Linking Zettelkasten’s between multiple people is called…the internet. Think about it. A digital Zettelkasten is just a website with a search engine, tags, and links to other pages. Today we call mutliple websites that are interlinked the internet. So the solution to these ideas? You should only have 1 Zettelkasten, period. It should contain all your notes for every topic learn and idea you have.</li>
</ul>
<p>Your Zettelkasten should not be connected to other people. Why? Because your Zettelkasten is your personal thought land. You should not be concerned with writing notes in a way that others would understand. Heck, use pigpen to write your own! By connecting to ther people’s Zettelkastens your are forced to solve the problem of interpersonal communication (and privacy for that matter) which interrupts brainstorming and research. Save linking to other people for mediums that are built for this such as blogs, research papers, and tweats.</p>

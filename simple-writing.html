<p>Research papers are difficult to read. And I’m learning that it’s not because I am unintelligent or ignorant. It’s that the author is a poor editor.</p>
<p>Here are a few tips for writing well<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Write in a manner that’s easy to read aloud.</li>
<li>Include humans in your writing <a href="./humans-in-sentences.html">(see humans-in-sentences)</a>.</li>
<li>Tell a story; not a bunch of facts.</li>
<li>Place verbs as close to nouns as possible</li>
<li>Avoid paranthetical text in sentences <a href="./parenthetical-texts.html">(see parenthetical-texts)</a>.</li>
<li>Don’t mangle ideas together. Sentences, paragraphs, etc should have a ingle idea</li>
<li>Build up and then make a point; don’t make your point and then hurry to give its proof aftarwards.</li>
<li>Make conclusions of sentences match subjects of following sentences <a href="./context-and-writing.html">(see context-and-writing)</a>.</li>
<li>State the obvious; but not “too obvious”. - someone will thank you later.</li>
<li>Avoid technical words that only your colleges would know (jargon).</li>
</ul>

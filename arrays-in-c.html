<p>Arrays in the C programming have always been a softspot for me. They’re simple when you understand basic computer memory models and fun to play with once you’ve learned pointers. Here’s a few facts you need to keep in mind.</p>
<ul>
<li>There is no empty array in C</li>
<li>All arrays must have a predetermined C given to them at compile time<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>.</li>
<li>Elements of an array must be of the same memory size. I avoid saying “type” because in C we think in terms of the computer memory model not types from type theory. As such an <code>int[]</code> could very well contain <code>bool</code> values due to casting.</li>
</ul>
<p>The first element of an array is stored in a memory cell with a particular address (we’ll call <code>a ∈ N</code>). The second element in the array is stored at an adjecent address (<code>a+1</code>). The empty array doesn’t exist in C.</p>

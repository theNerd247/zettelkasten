<h1>The Lords Compassion</h1>
<p>Joel 2:13</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“… And rend your heart and not your garments” Now return to the LORD your God. <em>For He is gracious and compassionate. Slow to anger, abounding in lovingkindness</em> And relenting of evil</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Joel 2:25</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Then I will make up to you for the years That the swarming locust has eaten. The creeping locust, the stripping locust and the gnawing locust, My great army which I sent among you. You will have plenty to eat and be satisfied. And praise the name of the LORD your God Who has dealt wondrously with you; Then My people will never be put to shame.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Psalm 103:2-5</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Who pardons all your iniquities Who heals all your diseases Who redeems your life from the pit Who crowns you with lovingkindness and compassion Who satisfies your years with good things. So that your youth is renewed like the eagle.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Psalm 103:8-14</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The LORD is compassionate and gracious, Slow to anger and abounding in lovingkindness He will not always strive with us. Nor will He keep His anger forever. He has not dealt with us according to our sins. Nor rewarded us according to our iniquities For as high as the heavens are above the earth, So great is His lovingkindness toward those who fear Him. As far as the east is from the west, So far has He removed our transgressions from us. Just as a father has compassion on his children, So the LORD has compassion on those who fear Him. For He Himself knows our frame; He is mindful that we are but dust.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Psalm 56:8</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You have taken account of my wanderings; Put my tears in Your bottle. Are they not in Your book?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The LORD does not take pleasure in bringing pain in our life. His heart is broken - He weeps - because of the sin I commit and because of the sins committed against me. He is not emotionless in His discipline - He records all my tears. But His anger can be kindled. Repeated defiance will make Him scourge us. But it is a scourging that we can bear up against - not one to destroy us but to bring us back into fellowship with Him.</p>
<p>When I am are under His discipline I cry out. And when I pause I wonder if He thinks “Quit whining! You humans are such babies. Always worrying and never trusting. Suck it and take it like a man! I’m not hurting you”. But Psalm 103:14 paints a different picture. He knows that when He disciplines us we will hurt. And He wants us to cry out to Him. Telling God you’re in pain when you’re disciplined is a very appropriate response.</p>
<p>Remember the LORD is compassionate - He knows your pain - and quick to forgive.</p>
